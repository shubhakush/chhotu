Chhotu is a 3D game developed using Unity 3D framework. Since the whole code folder size limit exceeds 100Mb, we upload the whole code on our google drive . The link (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwXOM2oHZ75tWGlaM1FaVF9ibGs/view) will take you to the folder containing the code alongwith relevant instruction to execute it on the unity 3D framework itself.

We have also play online on (http://chhotu.pe.hu/compile/compile.html)
